## Key Files

- **`Dockerfile`**:

  - Defines the Docker image for deploying EventlyAI. It sets up the environment and installs necessary dependencies.

- **`app.py`**:

  - Contains the main application logic for EventlyAI.
  - Typically includes:
    - **Model Loading**: Code to load the trained models.
    - **Inference Functions**: Functions for making predictions with the models.
    - **API Endpoints**: If applicable, endpoints for serving predictions.

- **`requirements.txt`**:
  - Lists the Python packages required to run EventlyAI. This ensures the environment has all the necessary libraries.

## Basic Usage

1. **Set Up the Environment**:

   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Run the Application**:

   - Execute `app.py` to start the EventlyAI application:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Access the application via the specified port (usually set in the script or Docker configuration).

3. **Docker Setup**:
   - Build and run the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` if deploying EventlyAI in a containerized environment:
     ```bash
     docker build -t eventlyai-app .
     docker run -p 8000:8000 eventlyai-app
     ```
   - Adjust the port number as needed based on your application's configuration.

## Additional Information

EventlyAI is part of the broader MLOps pipeline, designed to handle model deployment and inference. It integrates with other components of the project to provide a seamless workflow for managing machine learning models.
