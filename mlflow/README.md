# MLflow Component

This directory contains the setup for MLflow, a platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. MLflow is used for tracking experiments, managing model versions, and serving models.

## Directory Structure

mlflow/
│
├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile for MLflow setup
├── mlflow_script.py # Script for running MLflow tracking and serving
└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies for MLflow

## Key Files

- **`Dockerfile`**:

  - Defines the Docker image for deploying MLflow. It sets up the MLflow server environment and installs required dependencies.

- **`mlflow_script.py`**:

  - Contains the main script for interacting with MLflow. This includes setting up MLflow tracking, logging experiments, and potentially serving models.
  - Key functions:
    - **Experiment Tracking**: Logs metrics, parameters, and models during training.
    - **Model Serving**: Provides endpoints for model inference if configured.

- **`requirements.txt`**:
  - Lists the Python packages required to run MLflow. It ensures that the MLflow environment has all the necessary libraries.

## Basic Usage

1. **Set Up the Environment**:

   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Run MLflow Tracking**:

   - Execute `mlflow_script.py` to start tracking experiments and logging model details:
     ```bash
     python mlflow_script.py
     ```

3. **Docker Setup**:
   - Build and run the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` if deploying MLflow in a containerized environment:
     ```bash
     docker build -t mlflow-app .
     docker run -p 5000:5000 mlflow-app
     ```
   - Access the MLflow UI at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view experiment results and manage models.

## Additional Information

MLflow helps in tracking and managing machine learning experiments, making it easier to reproduce and compare results. This component integrates with your machine learning workflow to provide robust experiment tracking and model management capabilities.

For more detailed instructions and updates, please refer to the main `README.md` in the root of the project.
